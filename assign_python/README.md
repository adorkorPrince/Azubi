Nana recently started a consulting business where he is paid based on the number of hours and minutes he works on client projects.

He needs a time tracking program, where he enters the date and the time he started working on a task, and then the date and time when he finished a particular task. 

The program calculates the hours he spent on a task. It then calculates the amount of money Nana made tackling the task. 

Time entered and information from the program should be stored in a csv or excel file for future referencing.
